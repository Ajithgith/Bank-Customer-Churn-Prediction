# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction

The dataset contains various features that describe each customer, such as their credit score, country, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, credit card status, active membership, estimated salary, and churn status. The churn status indicates whether a customer has churned/exited or not. The dataset is used to analyze and understand factors that contribute to customer churn and to build predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning. The goal is to develop strategies and interventions to reduce churn and improve customer retention. The dataset is slightly imbalanced by the ratio of 80:20 where 80% of the values are for the Class 0(Not Churned) and 20% for the Class 1(Churned)
